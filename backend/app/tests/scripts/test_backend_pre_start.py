"""Test the `init` helper in `app.backend_pre_start`.

The production `init()` function performs a very small health-check: it opens a
SQLModel `Session` and executes a simple `SELECT 1`.  The goal of this test is
therefore to verify that:

1. `init()` does not raise an exception when the connection succeeds (we stub
   the connection so it always "succeeds").
2. Exactly one call to `Session.exec` is made â€“ confirming that the health-check
   query is executed.

A real database is not required for this test.  Instead we patch
`app.backend_pre_start.Session` so that it returns a `MagicMock` acting as a
context manager.  This keeps the test fast, deterministic and independent of
external resources.
